    "3. [How we're teaching computers to understand pictures](https://www.ted.com/talks/fei_fei_li_how_we_re_teaching_computers_to_understand_pictures/up-next) by Fei-Fei Li, 2015 - When a very young child looks at a picture, she can identify simple elements: \"cat,\" \"book,\" \"chair.\" Now, computers are getting smart enough to do that too. What's next? In a thrilling talk, computer vision expert Fei-Fei Li describes the state of the art -- including the database of 15 million photos her team built to \"teach\" a computer to understand pictures -- and the key insights yet to come.\n",

    "4. [The wonderful and terrifying implications of computers that can learn](https://www.ted.com/talks/jeremy_howard_the_wonderful_and_terrifying_implications_of_computers_that_can_learn/up-next) by Jeremy Howard at TED 2014 - What happens when we teach a computer how to learn? Technologist Jeremy Howard shares some surprising new developments in the fast-moving field of deep learning, a technique that can give computers the ability to learn Chinese, or to recognize objects in photos, or to help think through a medical diagnosis. (One deep learning tool, after watching hours of YouTube, taught itself the concept of \"cats.\") Get caught up on a field that will change the way the computers around you behave ... sooner than you probably think.\n",

Today, computer vision systems do it with greater than 99 percent accuracy. How? Joseph Redmon works on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) system, an open-source method of object detection that can identify objects in images and video -- from zebras to stop signs -- with lightning-quick speed. In a remarkable live demo, Redmon shows off this important step forward for applications like self-driving cars, robotics and even cancer detection.\n",

Robotics engineer Radhika Nagpal studies the collective intelligence displayed by insects and fish schools, seeking to understand their rules of engagement. In a visionary talk, she presents her work creating artificial collective power and previews a future where swarms of robots work together to build flood barriers, pollinate crops, monitor coral reefs and form constellations of satellites.\n",
