## Week 1 Assignment
  1. Finish "AI For Everyone" Week 1.  Be ready for a quiz for it.
  2. Reading assignment: "Make your own neural network"
      From beginning to "A Simple Predicting Machine"
  3. Watch Famous Lecture Series Week 1. Be ready for a quiz.

------------------------

## Group assignment 1 - Make quizzes like a professor
Each group makes two questions per lecture listed in "Famous Lecture Series" every week.
  2. Make two questions per lecture and post them to Piazza and a note such that we all can see them.
    - Make sure not to make duplicated questions. You must compare them with ones made by other groups.
    - Use "Markdown" option in Piazza editor to write.
    - Follow the format in the example provided.
  3. Due is Thurday Noon.
    - We will have a quiz on the next day. The quizes will be a good reference for the quiz.

## Group assignment 2 - Read and Present
Read and present the ebook, "Make your own neural network". Two groups per class work together.
Remake the pdf provided by the author to improve. A couple of template ppt files are provided if needed.
  1. Group 1: (10/22)
    - Classifying is not very different from Predicting
    - Training a Simple Classifier
  2. Group 2: (10/22)
    - Sometimes One Classifier is not enough
    - Neurons, Nature's Computing Machines
  3. Group 3: (10/25)
    - Following Signals Trhough A Neural network
    - Matrix Mulitiplication is Useful
  3. Group 4: (10/25)
    - A Three Layer Example with Matrix Mulitiplication
    - Learning Weights From More Than One Node
  4. Group 5: (10/29)
    - Backpropagating Errors From More Output Nodes
  5. Group 1: (10/29)
    - Backpropagating Errors To More Layers
  6. Group 2: (11/1)
    - Backpropagating Errors with Matrix Mulitiplication
  7. Group 3: (11/1)
    - How Do We Actually Update Weights
  8. Group 4: (11/5)
    - Weight Udpate Worked Examples
  9. Group 5: (11/5)
    - Neural Network with Python
  10. Group 1~5:
    - The MNIST Dataset of Handwritten Numbers
