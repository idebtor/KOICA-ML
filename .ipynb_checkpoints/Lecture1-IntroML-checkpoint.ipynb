    "Artificial intelligence (AI) is not a new concept, it is been around for decades, and still, it is much unexplored. Did you know that the first ideas revolving AI can be traced back to the ‘40s? Nevertheless, it is still a field that is in its infancy and a concept that we still don’t know a lot about. There is a lot of controversy revolving this topic, too. While part of the community is ready to strike with full force ahead into a huge uncharted territory that is AI, part of community raises some serious questions and ethical dilemmas. For example, Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk publicly declared their fears and worries, while Mark Zuckerberg and Ray Kurzweil, on the other hand, are ready to become cyborgs. Still, the world doesn’t wait for anyone, and the world of AI is waiting even less, so here we are.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is actually AI? Just like with any emerging field, this simple question still has no clear answer. However, we can describe what the main goals of AI are, (apart from destroying humanity, of course:)). There are categories of problems, problems with many subtle factors that we cannot describe with an algorithm. These problems we, as humans, know how to solve by learning and computers don’t have this ability.\n",

    "\n",
    "What's the difference between the two? Why does a computer multiply better than we do, but can’t recognize a cat? To understand this, you need to think about what a computer is good at or isn't. What a computer does best is to calculate addition and subtraction at an extremely high rate. However, computers have their downside, the downside is that computers only work as they are made. If the input is multiplication or addition, it performs excellently. The programmer has no problem coding it. However, if the input is a media, such as a cat picture, there will be a wide variety of input values.  For example, even if a cat looks different it should be recognized as a cat, even if its fur color is different, or if its running and not stationary it should still be recognized as a cat. While programmers should take this input into account, this is not possible. So, for the past 50 years, it's been difficult to figure out how to recognize objects on the computer."

    "It's a different story now. Because of machine learning, computers have finally begun to recognize cats. Within decades of the invention of computers, it can incrementally perceive the world just as humans do. That is, if we use a lot of data to \" teach\" the computer. For example, in 2012, Google engineers and Stanford professor Andrew Ng published a study. 10 million Internet images (200 x200), 1,000 computers(1,600 cores) were used to recognize the cat. What was so important that the New York Times reported it? The most important thing in this presentation was that the computer learned to distinguish cats by learning by ifself, not by a special program to distinguish cats. We should consider why it's so special and why machine learning is receiving all the spotlight right now. To expalin this,  we should understand the difference  between machine learning and coding  It'll help in understanding the importance.  \n",

    "# Difference between Traditional Programming and Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional code works on a rule-base  and so the programmer writes the code,  and the computer performs  according to the code.  For example,  if you create a program that  distinguishes spam mail,  you need to set rules and code  how the programmer will handle each  word that that is found in spam mail.  Then, when the mail comes in,  the computer calculates how many of the  spam classification words are in the mail  and processes it as spam.  The programmer has to learn spam,  and then he has to code his knowledge  and tell the computer what to do with it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, machine learning is not like that  Machine learning means that machines can  make themselves capable of  determining which email is spam.  It's amazing how computers  __learn__ by themselves.  This is why people are worried that  something terrible has started.  To improve the performance  of traditional programs,  programmers must find new rules  and add coding for each of them.  The problem was that humans  could write code for spam,  but not a code which differentiates cats.  Why can't I write the code?  Because there are so many kinds of cats  it was impossible to characterize every  cat in the world by traditional code.  However, with machine learning,  your computer can learn to distinguish spam  by learning the spam e-mails that  are stored in your spam mailbox.  It can learn to recognize cats  that is, if it is given enough data.  But what's even more surprising  is that the algorithm which distinguishes  spam and cats are pretty much similar.  The more spam you have,  the computer categorizes spam better.  Because it can educate itself much better.  \n",

    "# Definition of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you define machine learning?  Today, I don't think we need to worry.  About 60 years ago,  Arthur Samuel, in 1959,  defined machine learning, __\"Field of Study that gives  computers the ability  to learn without being  explicitly programmed\"__  What we will be able to do  better through machine learning  will depend on our imagination.  In addition to machine learning,  you also hear a lot of words like  artificial intelligence and deep learning  and these terms need to be summarized.  First, artificial intelligence  is a very old term,  and it's quite comprehensive.  Sixty years ago,  scientists had already talked about  artificial intelligence (AI),  and it has been widely used in  a broad sense up to this day.  Machine learning is a field of  such artificial intelligence,  and it can be thought of as a  method of learning using data.  Deep learning, which has  been developing rapidly  over the past decade or so,  is a field of machine learning using a  multi-layer artificial neural ANN algorithm.  "

A learning method in which  computers can practice a variety of methods  and find patterns in the data itself.  I introduced in the beginning of the course the computer learns to recognize and classify the cat as a cat with 10 million images.  This was an example of  unsupervised learning.  Analyzing newspaper articles  to group political, economic,  and current news stories  is part of unsupervised learning.  Another example would be  to automatically classify a given  number of images into different genres  without any clue that's  also unsupervised learning.\n",

It's learning.  It learned this by being  rewarded for its behavior.  Reinforced learning is a  learning method which rewards  while being rewarded for its actions  and continues to act (policy)  towards the maximum reward.  There's another good example.  It's AlphaGo  which played a game against professional  Go player Lee Se-dol in March 2016.  There are so many Go plays  that no computer on Earth can  calculate the number of cases in Go.  However, AlphaGo learned to compensate  for its good plays through  reinforcement learning.  It was learning by watching  countless numbers of play records.  This is a record from the fourth play  It's the fourth out of five plays  People commented there was one \"play by God\" in the fourth game.  Do you remember which play it was?  It was the 78th play.  \n",
