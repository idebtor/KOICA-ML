  - link: (YouTube) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40riCqvRoMs
  - length: 7:30
  - lecturer: Fei Fei Li, Stanford Vision Lab Director and Professor
  - contents: When a very young child looks at a picture, she can identify simple elements: "cat," "book," "chair." Now, computers are getting smart enough to do that too. What's next? In a thrilling talk, computer vision expert Fei-Fei Li describes the state of the art — including the database of 15 million photos her team built to "teach" a computer to understand pictures — and the key insights yet to come.

------------------
#### Question 1
The technology has been advanced in many areas. It is relatively recent that a computer can recognize objects. Select items that the computer is still struggling to do better.  Answer the following questions based on the lecture provided if there is an ambiguity. Select all that apply.
1. Classifying dogs by all different kind breeds
2. Distinguish a child swimming or drowning in a swimming pool
3. Distinguish objects on the road whether or not a car can run over it
4. Identifying the manufacturer, brand and model of cars passing by on the road
5. Finding a small defect among millions of the same objects.
6. Finding the most beautiful shot from my photo albumn

  - link: (YouTube) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgxsv1riJhI
  - length: 7:30
  - lecturer: Joseph Redmon, Compuer Vision YOLO와 Darknet의 개발자입니다.
  - contents: en years ago, researchers thought that getting a computer to tell the difference between a cat and a dog would be almost impossible. Today, computer vision systems do it with greater than 99 percent accuracy. How? Joseph Redmon works on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) system, an open-source method of object detection that can identify objects in images and video -- from zebras to stop signs -- with lightning-quick speed. In a remarkable live demo, Redmon shows off this important step forward for applications like self-driving cars, robotics and even cancer detection.


#### Question 3
What is the main topic that the lecturer, Joseph Redmon, emphasizes in his lecture?
1. The computers can now recognize objects accurately than before.
2. The computers can now recognize objects as well as its attributes as well.
3. The computers can now recognize objects very fast than before.
4. The computers can now recognize more objects accurately than before.

__Answer:__ _____________

#### Question 4
The technology he used to achieve this amazing results comes since `______________` . Select all that apply.
1. his computer has the most powerful GPU/TPU installed for the purpose
2. his algorithm(software) scans the photo only to recognize
3. the customizing algorithm(software) detects only some specific objects
4. the algorithm(software) has been pretrained before.

## Week 2

1. What AI is - and isn't

- link: (TED) https://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_thrun_and_chris_anderson_the_new_generation_of_computers_is_programming_itself
- link: (YouTube) What AI is -- and isn't | Sebastian Thrun and Chris Anderson
- length: 24:14
- lecturers:
  - Sebastian Thrun - Udacity Founder, Professor of Stanford University
  - Chris Anderson - TED Director
- contents: Educator and entrepreneur Sebastian Thrun wants us to use AI to free humanity of repetitive work and unleash our creativity. In an inspiring, informative conversation with TED Curator Chris Anderson, Thrun discusses the progress of deep learning, why we shouldn't fear runaway AI and how society will be better off if dull, tedious work is done with the help of machines. "Only one percent of interesting things have been invented yet," Thrun says. "I believe all of us are insanely creative ... [AI] will empower us to turn creativity into action."

2. How we can teach computers to make sense of our emotions

- link: (TED) https://www.ted.com/talks/raphael_arar_how_we_can_teach_computers_to_make_sense_of_our_emotions
- link: (YouTube) https://youtu.be/hs-YuHv0vUk
- length: 11:13
- lecturer: Raphael Arar, Designer in IBM
- contents: How can we make AI that people actually want to interact with? Raphael Arar suggests we start by making art. He shares interactive projects that help AI explore complex ideas like nostalgia, intuition and conversation -- all working towards the goal of making our future technology just as much human as it is artificial.

## Week 3

1. Can a robot pass a university entrance exam?

- link: (TED) https://www.ted.com/talks/noriko_arai_can_a_robot_pass_a_university_entrance_exam/
- link: (YouTube) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXcFEhl7ynM
- length: 13:37
- lecturer: Noriko Arai, Artificial intelligence researcher, at University of Tokyo
- contents: Meet Todai Robot, an AI project that performed in the top 20 percent of students on the entrance exam for the University of Tokyo -- without actually understanding a thing. While it's not matriculating anytime soon, Todai Robot's success raises alarming questions for the future of human education. How can we help kids learn the things that humans can do better than AI?
The TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less). Look for talks on Technology, Entertainment and Design -- plus science, business, global issues, the arts and more.

2. How AI can enhance our memory, work and social lives

- link: (YouTube) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJMhz7JlPvA
- length: 9:46
- lecturer: Tom Gruber, co-founded Siri Inc., which created the Siri intelligent personal assistant
- contents: How smart can our machines make us? Tom Gruber, co-creator of Siri, wants to make "humanistic AI" that augments and collaborates with us instead of competing with (or replacing) us. He shares his vision for a future where AI helps us achieve superhuman performance in perception, creativity and cognitive function -- from turbocharging our design skills to helping us remember everything we've ever read and the name of everyone we've ever met. "We are in the middle of a renaissance in AI," Gruber says. "Every time a machine gets smarter, we get smarter."

## Week 4

1. The incredible inventions of intuitive AI
- link: (TED) https://www.ted.com/talks/maurice_conti_the_incredible_inventions_of_intuitive_ai
- link: (Youtube) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR5N2Jl8k14
- length: 15:23
- lecturer: Maurice Conti (Designer, futurist), Chief Innovation Officer at Alpha
- contents: What do you get when you give a design tool a digital nervous system? Computers that improve our ability to think and imagine, and robotic systems that come up with (and build) radical new designs for bridges, cars, drones and much more -- all by themselves. Take a tour of the Augmented Age with futurist Maurice Conti and preview a time when robots and humans will work side-by-side to accomplish things neither could do alone.
