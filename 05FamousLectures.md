  - lecturer: Kai-Fu Lee · Investor, computer scientist, CAt Sinovation Ventures, Kai-Fu Lee invests in the next generation of Chinese high-tech companies.
  - contents: AI is massively transforming our world, but there's one thing it cannot do: love. In a visionary talk, computer scientist Kai-Fu Lee details how the US and China are driving a deep learning revolution -- and shares a blueprint for how humans can thrive in the age of AI by harnessing compassion and creativity. "AI is serendipity," Lee says. "It is here to liberate us from routine jobs, and it is here to remind us what it is that makes us human."

2. [Fake videos of real people -- and how to spot them](https://youtu.be/o2DDU4g0PRo)
  - length: 7:15
  - lecturer: Supasorn Suwajanakorn
  - contents: Do you think you're good at spotting fake videos, where famous people say things they've never said in real life? See how they're made in this astonishing talk and tech demo. Computer scientist Supasorn Suwajanakorn shows how, as a grad student, he used AI and 3D modeling to create photorealistic fake videos of people synced to audio. Learn more about both the ethical implications and the creative possibilities of this tech -- and the steps being taken to fight against its misuse.

3. [The wonderful and terrifying implications of computers that can learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4kyRyKyOpo)

  - length: 19:49
  - contents: What happens when we teach a computer how to learn? Technologist Jeremy Howard shares some surprising new developments in the fast-moving field of deep learning, a technique that can give computers the ability to learn Chinese, or to recognize objects in photos, or to help think through a medical diagnosis. (One deep learning tool, after watching hours of YouTube, taught itself the concept of “cats.”) Get caught up on a field that will change the way the computers around you behave … sooner than you probably think.
